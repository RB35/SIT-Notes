# Contributing
Thank you for showing interest in helping out with this documentation!

You can fix issues with existing content or even add your own new content.

This websites content is contained within a github repo. To make edits you will first fork the repository commit your changes and then create a PR to merge your changes into the original repo to get your changes on the site.

To view the Github repository click the Github logo up the top of the page. Or if you want to just make a edit to a page you can click the `Edit this page` link at the bottom of each page. This will automatically take you to the relevant page in the Github editor.

All pages on this site are generated using markdown files. These are basically fancy text files that you can add extra formatting to. You may already be familiar with markdown as it is what you write Github README files. If you are unfamiliar or want to brushup on your syntax check out this guide [Basic Markdown Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

Files aren't automatically added to the sidebar they first need to be added in `config.mts`. If your adding a new page feel free to add it here. If your not confident to do this not don't worry, as long as you add your file to the correct unit and section folder I will add the side bar entry when I check your PR.

If you need any help or have questions feel free to message me on teams. My name is RILEY ANGUS BROWN. (Deakin Teams)

Also I will add some rules for contributing:
* Do not use any AI in creating content for this site. Even if just for spelling/grammar improvements. We will read over your PR and improve spelling and grammar if needed.
* Don't use any content copied from other sources. This includes images diagrams and images must be your own.
* Definitely do not just copy content from university provided content.
